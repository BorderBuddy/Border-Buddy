# Contributing

## What should I work on?

Please have a look at our GitHub issues. Anything currently unassigned is up for grabs!

## What is your git flow?

Once you find something you'd like to work on, please speak up and one of the admins will assign the issue to you. Then, make a branch appended with the issue number, ie, `update-contributing-#101`. When you are ready for a PR, please title it "closes" + the issue number, ie, `closes #101`. Please don't forget to include unit tests!

After you create a PR, one of the admins will review your code.

To get updates from master, we prefer merge over rebase.
