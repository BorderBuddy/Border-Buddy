			<p className="center">Under the Trump administration, more and more travelers face undue scrutiny when entering the United States. If you get detained at the border, it's too late to arrange for a lawyer to come represent you.</p>
			<p className="center">There are legal advocacy groups that provide free services to communities targeted by Trump's immigration policies. But they need to know of your arrival in advance. That's where we come in.</p>
		</div>

		<div className="col-12">
			<h2 className="mx-auto h1 center subtitle">How It Works</h2>
			<p className="center">After you register, we keep track of your flight's arrival information. If you make it through customs and immigration without any delays, send us a text and we'll know that you are OK.</p>
			<p className="center">If your flight has landed more than two hours ago and we still haven't heard from you, one of our partners will send a lawyer to the airport as your personal counsel. <em>It's that simple.</em></p>
